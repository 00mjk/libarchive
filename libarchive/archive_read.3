.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm archive_read_close ,
.Nm archive_read_finish ,
.Nm archive_read_free
.Nd functions for reading streaming archives
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In archive.h
.Ft int
.Fn archive_read_close "struct archive *"
.Ft int
.Fn archive_read_finish "struct archive *"
.Ft int
.Fn archive_read_free "struct archive *"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide a complete API for reading streaming archives.
The general process is to first create the
.Tn struct archive
object, set options, initialize the reader, iterate over the archive
headers and associated data, then close the archive and release all
resources.
.\"
.Ss Create archive object
See
.Xr archive_read_new 3 .
.\"
.Ss Enable filters and formats
See
.Xr archive_read_filter 3
and
.Xr archive_read_format 3 .
.\"
.Ss Set options
See
.Xr archive_read_set_options 3 .
.\"
.Ss Open archive
See
.Xr archive_read_open 3 .
.\"
.Ss Consume archive
See
.Xr archive_read_data 3 .
.\"
.Ss Release resources
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Fn archive_read_close
Complete the archive and invoke the close callback.
.It Fn archive_read_finish
This is a deprecated synonym for
.Fn archive_read_free .
The new name was introduced with libarchive 3.0.
Applications that need to compile with either libarchive 2
or libarchive 3 should continue to use the
.Fn archive_read_finish
name.
Both names will be supported until libarchive 4.0 is
released, which is not expected to occur earlier
than 2013.
.It Fn archive_read_free
Invokes
.Fn archive_read_close
if it was not invoked manually, then release all resources.
Note: In libarchive 1.x, this function was declared to return
.Ft void ,
which made it impossible to detect certain errors when
.Fn archive_read_close
was invoked implicitly from this function.
The declaration is corrected beginning with libarchive 2.0.
.El
.Pp
Note that the library determines most of the relevant information about
the archive by inspection.
In particular, it automatically detects
.Xr gzip 1
or
.Xr bzip2 1
compression and transparently performs the appropriate decompression.
It also automatically detects the archive format.
.Pp
A complete description of the
.Tn struct archive
and
.Tn struct archive_entry
objects can be found in the overview manual page for
.Xr libarchive 3 .
.Sh EXAMPLE
The following illustrates basic usage of the library.
In this example,
the callback functions are simply wrappers around the standard
.Xr open 2 ,
.Xr read 2 ,
and
.Xr close 2
system calls.

.Sh RETURN VALUES
Most functions return zero on success, non-zero on error.
The possible return codes include:
.Cm ARCHIVE_OK
(the operation succeeded),
.Cm ARCHIVE_WARN
(the operation succeeded but a non-critical error was encountered),
and
.Cm ARCHIVE_FATAL
(there was a fatal error; the archive should be closed immediately).
Detailed error codes and textual descriptions are available from the
.Fn archive_errno
and
.Fn archive_error_string
functions.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm libarchive
library first appeared in
.Fx 5.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm libarchive
library was written by
.An Tim Kientzle Aq kientzle@acm.org .
.Sh BUGS
Many traditional archiver programs treat
empty files as valid empty archives.
For example, many implementations of
.Xr tar 1
allow you to append entries to an empty file.
Of course, it is impossible to determine the format of an empty file
by inspecting the contents, so this library treats empty files as
having a special
.Dq empty
format.
