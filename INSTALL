On most Unix-like systems, you should be able to install libarchive
and bsdtar using the following common steps:
    ./configure
    make
    make install

If you need to customize the target directories or otherwise adjust
the build setting, use
    ./configure --help
to list the configure options.

If you are developing libarchive and need to update the
configure script and other build files:
    /bin/sh build/autogen.sh

On non-Unix-like systems, you should be able to create
build files suitable for your system by using "cmake".
You may need to first obtain a suitable version of cmake
for your system from http://cmake.org/
